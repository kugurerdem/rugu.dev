# Hi there!

I am Ugur, and you're now a guest on my website.

To give you a quick idea about me, I am a software developer who is also deeply
interested in philosophy and psychology. I usually explore and talk about the
subtle details of these areas. But I might occasionally share my personal
thoughts and plans as well.

For more details, such as how to contact, or who I am, please visit [about page](/about).
