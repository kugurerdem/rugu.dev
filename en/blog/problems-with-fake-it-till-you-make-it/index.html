If you don&rsquo;t see any problem with this, then why not phrase it more directly as: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK to manipulate others until you get what you want?&rdquo; At least that wording captures the Machiavellian intent.</p><p>If you take a more charitable reading, such as &ldquo;by acting like X, you eventually become like X. The actions you repeat become sticky, turn into habits, and eventually feel natural&rdquo;. Then I would ask, &ldquo;How is that even faking?&rdquo; For example, when you act the way a courageous person would act in a situation that requires courage, would you say that you are faking courage or that you just acted courageously?</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Excellence comes about as a result of habit. We become just by doing just acts, temperate by doing temperate acts, brave by doing brave acts.&rdquo;<br>- Aristotle</p></blockquote><p>Additionally, it is not very hard to find cases where this &ldquo;fake it&rdquo; logic fails. For example, if you are not able to do a pull-up, pretending you can do one is not going to help nearly as much as following exercises specifically designed for someone who cannot yet do a pull-up but wants to build the strength to get there. This is actually the opposite of faking: you acknowledge your current incapability and work from that starting point.</p><p>So, I think a way better piece of advice than &ldquo;fake it till you make it&rdquo; would be just something like &ldquo;make it till you make it&rdquo;</p></div></article><aside class=side><img class=author-image src=/ugur_img.jpg><hr><center><b>Uğur Erdem Seyfi</b></center><hr><div class=icon-container><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugur-erdem-seyfi target=_blank><img class="icon hover" src=/icons/linkedin.svg>
