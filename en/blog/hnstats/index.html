I like hanging out on Hacker News, reading essays. I also enjoy submitting essays I like that haven’t already been shared there. This way, the author gets recognition and others get to read something they might enjoy too. Plus, more karma never hurts. 😀
For that, I’ve been using an extension called What HN Says. The extension basically lets you see whether an HN discussion already exists for the page you’re viewing. If it does, it lists them and lets you open them in a new tab; If not, it makes submitting the link easy by opening the HN submission page with the title and URL prefilled. Despite being a simple app, I’ve been using it for a while and enjoying it."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="blog"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-05-17T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-05-17T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="og:image" content="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kugurerdem/hn-domain-stats/refs/heads/master/overview.png"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary_large_image"><meta name=twitter:image content="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kugurerdem/hn-domain-stats/refs/heads/master/overview.png"><meta name=twitter:title content="Introducing: HackerNews Domain Stats"><meta name=twitter:description content="You can quickly try the app through hnstats.rugu.dev Or, see the source code kugurerdem/hn-domain-stats

These analytics could be anything like: The total number of upvotes and comments the domain has received so far, how much time has passed since its first submission, how many unique users have submitted links from it, a graph of submission, upvote, and comment counts over time, and so on.</p><p>I&rsquo;d certainly be interested in seeing HN analytics for my own site from time to time.
