windows and prompting her to use services she doesn’t need. After checking her
phone and doing some online research, I found out that many others have also
complained about this issue.</p><p>Apparently, she was referring to pop-ups triggered by a pre-built program
called &ldquo;SIM Menu&rdquo;. This program basically allows operators to send
notifications and even generate pop-ups on your phone. And the frustrating part
is that most of these pop-ups seem to promote irrelevant services. If you
accidentally click &ldquo;OK&rdquo; when one of these pop-ups appears, you get charged by
your provider. It is a carefully set up trap designed to make you accidentally
subscribe to their unnecessary services and pay money.</p><p>Since I prefer simplicity and like to have control over the tools I use. I was
already thinking about removing the bloatware on my phone that came
pre-installed and can&rsquo;t be deleted through the interface. Hell, even some of
the fundamental apps, like a gallery or file manager, are filled with ads. It
gets on my nerves. So, I was already planning to learn how to remove these
bloatware and the situation I described earlier was the final straw for me.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve searched for tools to debloat Android phones and found <code>adb</code>, Android
Developer Bridge. It&rsquo;s basically a program which allows you to directly create
a shell session for your phone, similar to connecting to a remote server via
SSH (the only difference is that instead of connecting through the internet,
the connection is made via USB).</p><p>Since Android is essentially an OS based on the Linux Kernel, the shell you
connect to will most likely be a variant of the sh dialect. So, for those who
are familiar with working in UNIX environments, its very convenient to remove
or install packages and customize your phone this way.</p><p>In this essay, I document this process of removing bloatware from my phone
as a reference for future use. Hopefully, you find it helpful as well.</p><h1 id=enabling-usb-debugging-mode>Enabling USB Debugging Mode</h1><p>While it is possible to establish an ADB connection to your phone over Wi-Fi, I
chose to use ADB through a USB connection as using Wi-Fi involves certain
security risks. For instance, others on your Wi-Fi network could potentially
connect to your phone, especially if your phone doesn&rsquo;t have proper security
settings. Not to mention that you would need to set up your phone using ADB
through a USB connection first before initiating a Wi-Fi connection anyways.
Which kind of makes using WiFi seem more pointless as the reasons for
preferring Wi-Fi over USB are usually just convenience or not having a USB
cable available.</p><p>To connect your phone using adb via a USB connection, you need to enable USB
Debugging mode on your phone. I won&rsquo;t go into the specifics of this process as
it varies by phone. But for my own phone, I simply navigated to the &ldquo;About&rdquo;
section and tapped &ldquo;MIUI Version&rdquo; multiple times to switch into Developer Mode.
Then, I searched for the &ldquo;USB Debugging&rdquo; option and enabled it.</p><h1 id=connecting-to-your-phone-via-a-shell-session>Connecting to your phone via a Shell Session</h1><p>Once you&rsquo;ve installed <code>adb</code>, you can view the manual by typing <code>adb help</code>. You
can also refer to the <a href=https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/modules/adb/+/refs/heads/master/docs/user/adb.1.md>online
documentation</a>.</p><p>To connect to your phone via a shell session, simply type <code>adb shell</code> and
you&rsquo;re good to go. Most standard UNIX commands such as <code>ls</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>echo</code>,
<code>grep</code>, and more can be used.</p><p>Keep in mind that you don&rsquo;t need to enter a shell session just to run specific
commands. You can also use the <code>adb shell &lt;cmd></code> pattern to run your particular
command <code>&lt;cmd></code>. This approach simply creates a shell session, executes your
command, and closes the session, while forwarding the stdout to your current
shell session.</p><h1 id=uninstalling-bloatware>Uninstalling Bloatware</h1><p>The Command Line Interface (CLI) tool used in Android for interaction with the
Android Package Manager is <code>pm</code>. This tool basically allows you to list,
install, or uninstall software packages.</p><p>To list the currently installed packages, execute the following command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>pm list packages
</code></pre><p>To view only the default apps on Android, enter this command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>pm list packages | grep &#39;android&#39;
</code></pre><p>At this point, I would advice you to search for other unwanted pre-installed
apps known to come with your phone&rsquo;s brand as well as android packages which
are known to be bloatware. Take a list of these apps for future reference so
you can easily repeat this process if you need it later again.</p><p>To delete a specific app from your phone, you first need to identify its
package name. You can accomplish this by searching for it on the internet.
However if you can&rsquo;t still find it, you should be able to locate the app&rsquo;s &ldquo;apk
package code&rdquo; directly on your phone. This process can vary depending on the
phone you&rsquo;re using, so I suggest you look up how to find package codes for
applications on your specific phone model.</p><p>Also, be careful to not to delete anything critical for your system to work. Do
not delete a package if you are not sure that it is not something system
critical.</p><p>Once you get the package.name, you can just run the following command in the
adb shell:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>pm uninstall --user 0 package.name
</code></pre><p>Here, <code>--user 0</code> specifies the user for which you want to uninstall the
package. User 0 is typically the device&rsquo;s default or primary user. When I have
run the command <code>pm uninstall</code> without this, it would say package is
successfully deleted but the package would still remain on my phone.</p><p>Keep in mind that we could have also used the following command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 package.name
</code></pre><p>Or even:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>adb uninstall --user 0 package.name
</code></pre><h1 id=automating-the-process>Automating the Process</h1><p>Remember that I told you to make a list of the packages you remove. This was
for to make the debloating process easier if you need to do it a second
time on your phone.</p><p>I use a specific <a href=https://github.com/kugurerdem/android-bloatwares>git
repository</a> for this purpose.
In this repository, I have a file named <code>bloatwares.txt</code> that contains the
package names of certain prebuilt applications for Mi, Xiaomi, Android, and
third-party applications.</p><p>If I ever need to debloat my phone, or anyone else&rsquo;s, all I need to do is to
run the following command:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>cat bloatwares.txt | xargs adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0
</code></pre><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>If you haven&rsquo;t already started, I strongly encourage you to consider debloating
your phone. Install <code>adb</code> on your computer, connect to your phone using it,
identify packages that seem unnecessary, and free your device from the unwanted
&lsquo;guests.&rsquo;</p><p>Go ahead and take back at least a partial ownership of your phone by getting
rid of these intruders!</p></div></article><aside class=side><img class=author-image src=/ugur_img.jpg><hr><center><b>Uğur Erdem Seyfi</b></center><hr><div class=icon-container><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugur-erdem-seyfi target=_blank><img class="icon hover" src=/icons/linkedin.svg>
