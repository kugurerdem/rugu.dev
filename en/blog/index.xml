Sure, the contents of plain text files are byte codes encoded in formats like ASCII, UTF8, or UTF16, and these byte codes are the ultimate source of truth. But in the end, it&amp;rsquo;s still your text editor that chooses how to interpret and represent that ultimate source of truth - binary codes into something recognizable to you. &lt;strong>This means that two different files could look the same, or the same file might appear differently depending on the editor(s) you use.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stop Being an NPC</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/npc/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/npc/</guid><description>&lt;p>When we encounter new information that conflicts with our current beliefs, we
typically follow one of the preceding options:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ignore the new information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Place it into your existing belief system, regardless of whether it is
consistent with your other beliefs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an ad hoc explanation to keep our beliefs intact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adjust or revise our existing beliefs.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Since the last option is typically the most demanding, and humans are
programmed through evolution to conserve energy, people usually choose the
first two options unless the information is crucial to their survival.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Concurrency, Parallelism and JS</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/concurrency-and-parallelism/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/concurrency-and-parallelism/</guid><description>&lt;p>Up until now, I was not aware that concurrency and parallelism were actually
different things since they are often used interchangeably by some. I just
learned that this is not the case while reading &lt;a href="https://www.braveclojure.com/concurrency/">Chapter
9&lt;/a> of the book &amp;ldquo;Clojure for the
Brave and True.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This made me want to learn more about concepts related to concurrency and
parallelism, especially concerning the programming language I know best:
JavaScript. So this essay is basically a collection of notes I made during this
learning process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Debug Smarter</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/debug-smarter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/debug-smarter/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this essay, I share some tips that I&amp;rsquo;ve found particularly beneficial for my
own debugging experience. Hope it helps the reader as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have any cool tips you&amp;rsquo;d also like to share, feel free to share them. I
might include them in the essay and give you credit for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="writing-logs-to-stderr">Writing Logs to STDERR&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that developers, myself included, often instinctively write debug
logs to STDOUT. While this might not cause problems if the program&amp;rsquo;s output
isn’t intended for other programs to consume, it becomes crucial when managing
multiple scripts that depend on each other—such as when one script writes to a
file that another reads.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Switching from Arch to NixOS</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/nixos/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/nixos/</guid><description>&lt;p>I’ve switched my desktop computer environment from Arch Linux to NixOS and used
it for about a month. I want to share my migration experience in case it might
interest or even help others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also want to thank my friends &lt;a href="https://github.com/onsah">Onur&lt;/a> and

&lt;p>As someone who likes playing with tools to understand how they work as well as
to match my preferences and ergonomic choices, I find myself frequently changing many
configurations on my system. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to realize
that I need a system to save and possibly automate these configuration
processes to save time in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Introducing: Mark Scroll Positions</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/mark-scroll-positions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/mark-scroll-positions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Try the extension in

&lt;p>I like reading blog posts a lot. While some of them are short and easy to read,
most of them are long and require more time to finish. When reading those long
essays, I take a break most of the time. Thus, when I re-open an essay, I
often lose the original place where I was reading. And if I
can remember where I was, then I manually scroll back there. This makes the
reading experience less smooth and more time-consuming.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Importance of Intentionality in Digital Consumption</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/intentional-digital-consumption/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/intentional-digital-consumption/</guid><description>&lt;p>A significant amount of my time of the day is spent interacting with computers
and cell phones. Some of these are due to habits (like having a feeling of
missing out), some are due to reasons related to dopamine (like watching
movies, tv-series or content which are supposed to be fun), and some are
related to work (software development) or productivity (writing, communicating,
researching). So, I am regularly exposed to all kinds of stimulants that are
available on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: The Art of Living by Thich Nhat Hanh</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/taol-by-nhat-hanh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/taol-by-nhat-hanh/</guid><description>&lt;p>After finishing the book &amp;ldquo;Siddhartha&amp;rdquo; by Hermann Hesse, I felt a need to
explore Buddhism in more detail. People often say that the core teachings of
Buddha offer a simple philosophy, which consists of only a few precepts and
essential concepts. I figured that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to spend some time
understanding the core principles of Buddhism, one of the most influential
religions and lifestyle philosophies. So, I started searching for resources to
learn more about it. During my search, I came across Thich Nhat Hanh and
discovered his book &amp;ldquo;The Art of Living&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contemplating Simultaneous Thinking, God and Logos</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I usually enjoy listening to certain types of ambient music or sounds when
doing repetitive tasks or even when meditating. In the comment section of these
kinds of videos, there are often people spreading love and writing nice things
to each other. After consuming so many videos of this kind, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to
predict that these kinds of comments would be present in a video even before
opening them. Sometimes, it felt like I was reading those comments without even
opening them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Debloating My Android Phone with ADB</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/debloat-with-adb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/debloat-with-adb/</guid><description>&lt;p>My mother recently mentioned that her phone is continually opening certain
windows and prompting her to use services she doesn’t need. After checking her
phone and doing some online research, I found out that many others have also
complained about this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently, she was referring to pop-ups triggered by a pre-built program
called &amp;ldquo;SIM Menu&amp;rdquo;. This program basically allows operators to send
notifications and even generate pop-ups on your phone. And the frustrating part
is that most of these pop-ups seem to promote irrelevant services. If you
accidentally click &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; when one of these pop-ups appears, you get charged by
your provider. It is a carefully set up trap designed to make you accidentally
subscribe to their unnecessary services and pay money.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Incorporating AI Tools Into My Terminal Workflow</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/vi-llm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/vi-llm/</guid><description>&lt;p>For those who may not be aware, Neovim is to me what a lightsaber is to a Jedi.
It forms an essential part of my routine, as I use it for nearly all my tasks
involving text. Be it drafting an essay, sending an email, or coding, Neovim is
my go-to tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, I have a deep admiration for the UNIX philosophy and its command-line
interface programs. It&amp;rsquo;s quite fascinating to observe how these small,
uncomplicated UNIX programs, designed to do one thing flawlessly, interact
effectively using piping mechanisms. Tools like sed, grep, awk, count, cut, and
many others, often prove to be incredibly useful for text processing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Keyboard Events Better</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/understanding-keyboard-events/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/understanding-keyboard-events/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this essay, I describe how I made a Node.js module to listen to keypresses
across the system on Linux machines using X. This experience helped me grasp
how the OS and Window Managers handle keyboard inputs, clarifying the reasons
behind an unexpected behavior I had encountered before, which I also mention in
the essay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about how keyboard events are handled,
this essay might be of interest to you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sockets and Message Framing</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/sockets-and-message-framing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/sockets-and-message-framing/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been involved in a fintech project that demands high performance,
posing various challenges related to a solid understanding of low-level
concepts, concepts that are primarily relevant to the inner workings of the
tools and protocols used beneath the surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One challenge involved separating two tasks into different processes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The main process, responsible for constructing the necessary business state from
incoming messages through a specific socket connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The monitoring process, allowing users to track relevant changes in the state.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reflections on My Journey into Software Development</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/computer-science-reflections/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/computer-science-reflections/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the following essay, I will reflect on my journey which led me to become a
software developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I intend this essay to be more of a personal reflection than a technical
advisement. But whether you are a seasoned programmer or a newcomer to the
world of software development, I hope that my experiences and insights will
provide valuable guidance and inspiration for your journey.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="before-college">Before College&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>When I was around 6 or 7 years old, I used to hang out with my
&lt;a href="https://www.yuempek.com">cousin&lt;/a> a lot. Whenever I would see him on his
computer, he would always be engaged in something interesting like developing
recreational applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On the Importance of Typing Fast</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/on-typing-fast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/on-typing-fast/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="typing-fast-is-important">Typing Fast is Important&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is often mentioned that the bottleneck in building software projects is not
one&amp;rsquo;s typing ability but ability to think clearly, and to design the
architecture effectively. Afterall, if typing speed was so essential to
programming, the time difference between rewriting an already existing project
with that of creating it from scratch would not be as high as it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While I agree that typing speed is not essential to programming, I cannot
relate on how this fact is used by lots of people to justify their thinking of
typing fast being not important for the development process.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Experience on Switching to Arch Linux</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</guid><description>&lt;p>About a year ago, I was invited to a pair coding session at the startup where I
was working. The developers were receiving consultancy from a strange person. At
one point, he took control of the screen sharing while reviewing some of the
pull requests that had been made to our codebase. When he shared his screen,
there was nothing but a black screen. Suddenly, a terminal screen appeared with
his keystrokes and he quickly began examining the codebase, providing feedback
on people&amp;rsquo;s code at a speed I had never seen before. He was able to jump between
different files in an instant, examining the diffs that were made in different
git commits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Argument for Idealism</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This essay was originally written for the &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Philosophy I&amp;rsquo;
(PHIL103) course at Bilkent University, where we delved into various branches of
philosophy, including consciousness. It reflects some of the thought processes
that arose as I grappled with these philosophical questions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to
note that this essay is not an exact reflection of my personal beliefs, but
rather an exercise in argumentation.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Despite this, I believe the arguments presented in this essay hold value and are
worth exploring. My hope is that this essay provides you with insight and
provokes thought, and that you find value in engaging with the ideas presented
here.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Should you use TypeScript?</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/typescript/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/typescript/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://dives.fyi/blog/typescript">see&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
