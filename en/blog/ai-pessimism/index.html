- <a target=_blank href=https://github.com/kugurerdem/rugudev/commits/master/content/english/blog/ai-pessimism.md>Updated </a>at 2025-03-07</i><hr><p>I frequently come across people thinking, &lsquo;Why bother learning something if AI will do it better than me in the future?&rsquo; Alongside this thought, I also noticed a rise in pessimism.</p><p>I believe this pessimism originates from three misconceptions: (1) overlooking the difference between instrumental and intrinsic value, (2) underestimating our ability to adapt to change, and (3) losing sight of what essentially matters.</p><h2 id=focus-more-on-intrinsic-value>Focus More on Intrinsic Value</h2><p>Some things need to be done by specifically you. Not because they can&rsquo;t be done by other beings, but because they are good for you when you do it yourself.</p><p><strong>You don’t exercise to lift things machines can already lift, you exercise to improve your health and life satisfaction. The same thing applies to fundamental activities like thinking and learning.</strong> The moment you start outsourcing what matters to you to AI just because it can do it on your behalf, remember that you may be sacrificing, instead of gaining.</p><p>In the end, I believe the things AI devalues the first are those that derive their worth from being tools, that is to say, things that shouldn’t end in themselves anyway.</p><p>For the things that <em>should</em> be ends in themselves, AI doesn’t change how you should approach them. You still need to exercise and take care of your diet for health, do your meditation, engage with philosophy for a meaningful life, and strive to understand important things especially the fundamentals of the domains on which you are operating.</p><p>AI might reduce the value of learning in some instrumental areas, but it mostly won&rsquo;t diminish the value of understanding itself. Given that the thing that you are trying to understand is meaningful.</p><h2 id=you-can-adapt>You Can Adapt</h2><p>Yes, as AI advances. Some skills lose their value over time. But that doesn’t mean learning them is pointless.</p><p>Some skills are valuable for a specific period, but it can still make sense to invest time in them. Think about foremen, they often learn the specific details of machines that may become outdated in the future, yet their value in some countries is higher than ever.</p><p>Also, humans are adaptable creatures. If the skills you’re learning now lose value and new ones become important, you can start learning those as well. Nothing is preventing you from adapting. Also, these changes don’t happen overnight. They occur gradually. So, people often overlook that they can adapt and adjust their direction over time.</p><h2 id=dont-lose-sight-of-what-matters>Don&rsquo;t Lose Sight of What Matters</h2><p>If we ever reach a point where learning and understanding become meaningless, we’ll likely face much bigger existential problems than unemployment.</p><p>Understanding the world, adapting to it, and striving to improve ourselves have been the best things we could do since the first days of humanity. Honestly, there&rsquo;s still nothing better we can do now.</p><p>So, instead of thinking, &lsquo;AI will take our jobs, so why bother?&rsquo; focus on improving yourself. Not because AI can&rsquo;t surpass you, but because <strong>there’s simply no better path than continuous self-improvement, no matter what the future holds.</strong> If there’s any meaning to life, I believe it’s deeply connected to this pursuit of growth and understanding.</p><blockquote><p>We cannot live better than in seeking to become better.</p><p>-Socrates</p></blockquote><p>Focus on the method that proved itself so far. Which is working hard and focusing on creating value.</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>The value of self-improvement and meaningful work goes beyond utility. It is tied to our sense of purpose and fulfillment.</p><p>Focus on what you can control: Your curiosity, adaptability, and drive to create value.</p></div></article></div></main><footer class=site-footer><div class=footer-content><a class=source-link href=https://github.com/kugurerdem/rugudev target=_blank><picture><source srcset=/icons/dark/git.svg media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img class=icon src=/icons/light/git.svg alt="git icon">
