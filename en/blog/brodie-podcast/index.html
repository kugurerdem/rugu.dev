I also received an email from <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@BrodieRobertson>Brodie Robertson</a>, telling me that he would soon release a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3VS75MVaEc">video</a> on his main channel about my essay. He also invited me to be a guest on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi5KJGW6pBiVqZCxuwebauKxHRmL54y9-">Tech Over Tea</a> podcast series.</p><p>It really surprised me to see a Linux content creator that I was already following not only featuring my essay but also inviting me to his podcast to discuss it. Despite not trusting my English speaking abilities as much as my writing, I told him I’d love to be a guest. I shared my concerns about not being very fluent in English and wanting to prepare beforehand. We briefly talked about the podcast format, and the topics we could cover, and set a date for the recording.</p><p>You can watch/listen to the Podcast here:</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen" loading=eager referrerpolicy=strict-origin-when-cross-origin src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w_4B6ZGOzPo?autoplay=0&amp;controls=1&amp;end=0&amp;loop=0&amp;mute=0&amp;start=0" style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 title="YouTube video"></iframe></div><p>We talked about how I came up with the Linux Asceticism essay, my Linux journey and workflow, &ldquo;Software Minimalism,&rdquo; and the idea of <a href=https://www.arp242.net/stupid-light.html>stupid light software</a>. We also covered the difference between essential and accidental complexity, creating personal blogs, my experience with NixOS, and some of the other essays I’ve written.</p><h2 id=reflections>Reflections</h2><p>At first, the idea of joining a podcast channel in a language that I was not as confident as my native language felt a bit stressful. I also had never been a guest on any YouTube channel before, let alone a channel that has over 10k+ subscribers. So, that also did not help much. But, I figured out that preparing could help me ease my stress. So, I prepared a lot before the day that the recording of the podcast took place. I started thinking, writing through possible topics we might discuss. I also asked one of my friends <a href=https://github.com/iag99>Aras</a> to interview me like he is Brodie, which also helped me relieve my stress a bit more.</p><p>While preparing for the podcast, I ended up with a file of around 9 pages if you consider each page to have around 500 words.</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>&gt; cat brodie-prep.md | wc -w
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#ae81ff>4614</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the end, I did not talk about most of the things I prepared for, but it still helped me a lot to feel ready.</p><p>I also realized that giving a disclaimer about my English skills upfront would help ease the pressure by lowering the audience&rsquo;s expectations. So, I went ahead and did that too.</p><p>In the end, the actual podcast experience was much smoother and less stressful than I had expected. Despite frequent misspellings and struggles expressing myself, I believe the podcast turned out to be better than my initial expectations. I think this is also partly thanks to Brodie being an experienced host who knows how to make the guests comfortable by keeping the setting relaxed as well.</p><p>But again, all these experiences reminded me of one of the famous Stoic quotes;</p><blockquote><p>We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.<br>- Seneca</p></blockquote><p>I think it was a great experience overall. And I also plan to turn some of the notes I&rsquo;ve taken in the preparation document into separate essays as well.</p></div></article><aside class=side><img class=author-image src=/ugur_img.jpg><hr><center><b>Uğur Erdem Seyfi</b></center><hr><div class=icon-container><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugur-erdem-seyfi target=_blank><img class="icon hover" src=/icons/linkedin.svg>
