In this blog, I write about a variety of topics related to software development, philosophy, and psychology. Most of the posts are self-reflections on subjects I either experiment with, learn about, or casually think about.
I highly value philosophy, particularly rational thinking. So I incorporate this value into how I approach software. To me, having a proper understanding of the fundamentals of the tools and concepts we use on the regular is far more valuable than to know any framework. I find it a requirement for success to have a philosophy of doing things for delivering products. And that’s also a part of what I try to achieve with some of my writings here."><meta property="og:locale" content="en"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="About Me"><meta name=twitter:description content="Full-stack software developer with a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Bilkent University (2023).
