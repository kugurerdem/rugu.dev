After checking her phone and doing some online research, I found out that many others have also complained about this issue.
Apparently, she was referring to pop-ups triggered by a pre-built program called &amp;ldquo;SIM Menu&amp;rdquo;. This program basically allows operators to send notifications and even generate pop-ups on your phone.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating AI Tools Into My Terminal Workflow</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/vi-llm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/vi-llm/</guid><description>For those who may not be aware, Neovim is to me what a lightsaber is to a Jedi. It forms an essential part of my routine, as I use it for nearly all my tasks involving text. Be it drafting an essay, sending an email, or coding, Neovim is my go-to tool.
Moreover, I have a deep admiration for the UNIX philosophy and its command-line interface programs. It&amp;rsquo;s quite fascinating to observe how these small, uncomplicated UNIX programs, designed to do one thing flawlessly, interact effectively using piping mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Understanding Keyboard Events Better</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/understanding-keyboard-events/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/understanding-keyboard-events/</guid><description>In this essay, I describe how I made a Node.js module to listen to keypresses across the system on Linux machines using X. This experience helped me grasp how the OS and Window Managers handle keyboard inputs, clarifying the reasons behind an unexpected behavior I had encountered before, which I also mention in the essay.
If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about how keyboard events are handled, this essay might be of interest to you.</description></item><item><title>Sockets and Message Framing</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/sockets-and-message-framing/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/sockets-and-message-framing/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been involved in a fintech project that demands high performance, posing various challenges related to a solid understanding of low-level concepts, concepts that are primarily relevant to the inner workings of the tools and protocols used beneath the surface.
One challenge involved separating two tasks into different processes:
The main process, responsible for constructing the necessary business state from incoming messages through a specific socket connection.
The monitoring process, allowing users to track relevant changes in the state.</description></item><item><title>Reflections on My Journey into Software Development</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/computer-science-reflections/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/computer-science-reflections/</guid><description>In the following essay, I will reflect on my journey which led me to become a software developer.
I intend this essay to be more of a personal reflection than a technical advisement. But whether you are a seasoned programmer or a newcomer to the world of software development, I hope that my experiences and insights will provide valuable guidance and inspiration for your journey.
Before College When I was around 6 or 7 years old, I used to hang out with my cousin a lot.</description></item><item><title>On the Importance of Typing Fast</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/on-typing-fast/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/on-typing-fast/</guid><description>Typing Fast is Important It is often mentioned that the bottleneck in building software projects is not one&amp;rsquo;s typing ability but ability to think clearly, and to design the architecture effectively. Afterall, if typing speed was so essential to programming, the time difference between rewriting an already existing project with that of creating it from scratch would not be as high as it is.
While I agree that typing speed is not essential to programming, I cannot relate on how this fact is used by lots of people to justify their thinking of typing fast being not important for the development process.</description></item><item><title>My Experience on Switching to Arch Linux</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</guid><description>About a year ago, I was invited to a pair coding session at the startup where I was working. The developers were receiving consultancy from a strange person. At one point, he took control of the screen sharing while reviewing some of the pull requests that had been made to our codebase. When he shared his screen, there was nothing but a black screen. Suddenly, a terminal screen appeared with his keystrokes and he quickly began examining the codebase, providing feedback on people&amp;rsquo;s code at a speed I had never seen before.</description></item></channel></rss>
