and cell phones. Some of these are due to habits (like having a feeling of
missing out), some are due to reasons related to dopamine (like watching
movies, tv-series or content which are supposed to be fun), and some are
related to work (software development) or productivity (writing, communicating,
researching). So, I am regularly exposed to all kinds of stimulants that are
available on the internet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contemplating Simultaneous Thinking, God and Logos</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</guid><description>&lt;p>I usually enjoy listening to certain types of ambient music or sounds when
doing repetitive tasks or even when meditating. In the comment section of these
kinds of videos, there are often people spreading love and writing nice things
to each other. After consuming so many videos of this kind, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to
predict that these kinds of comments would be present in a video even before
opening them. Sometimes, it felt like I was reading those comments without even
opening them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Argument for Idealism</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This essay was originally written for the &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Philosophy I&amp;rsquo;
(PHIL103) course at Bilkent University, where we delved into various branches of
philosophy, including consciousness. It reflects some of the thought processes
that arose as I grappled with these philosophical questions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to
note that this essay is not an exact reflection of my personal beliefs, but
rather an exercise in argumentation.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Despite this, I believe the arguments presented in this essay hold value and are
worth exploring. My hope is that this essay provides you with insight and
provokes thought, and that you find value in engaging with the ideas presented
here.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
