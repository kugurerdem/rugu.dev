and cell phones. Some of these are due to habits (like having a feeling of
missing out), some are due to reasons related to dopamine (like watching
movies, tv-series or content which are supposed to be fun), and some are
related to work (software development) or productivity (writing, communicating,
researching). So, I am regularly exposed to all kinds of stimulants that are
available on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite confident that it is not &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; for us human beings to be exposed
to lots of different kinds of digital stimulants at such a fast, mindless pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="we-cant-keep-up"&gt;We Can&amp;rsquo;t Keep Up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ways to consume stuff always seem to get faster and faster. For most people,
the content they consume is transforming from deeper and wider content to
shorter content that is in the form of compensated &amp;ldquo;pill&amp;quot;s. The existence of
&amp;ldquo;YouTube Shorts&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Instagram Reels&amp;rdquo; is a good example of this. I don&amp;rsquo;t think
there is an inherent problem with content presented in the form of &amp;ldquo;pills&amp;rdquo;. I
understand that they can be useful when we don&amp;rsquo;t have much time to grasp all
the details of a certain topic. However, the problem I see is that this way of
consuming content becoming the norm. Many of us constantly train our brains to
seek brief moments of feeling good, rather than deliberately focusing on one
concept and exploring it in more depth. And this happens all the time without
us even noticing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the key thing that we need to recognize is that the amount of
satisfaction (or benefit) that we obtain from consuming these contents does not
always seem to increase at the rate they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of our being, how we feel, and how we learn, are not solely
determined by the content or information we&amp;rsquo;re exposed to but also determined
by how we intentionally react to them. The way we do things is just as
important as what is being done. The effect of intentionally watching a certain
movie is not the same as watching randomly suggested YouTube videos &amp;hellip; The
effect of choosing a topic and taking the time to learn about it is not the
same as a random platform such as YouTube recommending a random video for
learning X in Y minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it, even when it comes to learning and education, we see the
results of this. There are concepts well-known to many people such as &amp;ldquo;tutorial
hell&amp;rdquo;. It is also quite common for people to feel like they are improving yet
they are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How content is consumed is just as important as the content that is being
consumed. We have to become more mindful when interacting in the realms of the
internet if we want to benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is where the concepts of &lt;em&gt;we pulling information&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;information
being pushed to us&lt;/em&gt; come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pulling-vs-being-pushed-to"&gt;Pulling vs Being Pushed To&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In communication, &amp;lsquo;pulling&amp;rsquo; refers to the phenomenon where the receiver
actively requests specific information and then receives it. &amp;lsquo;Pushing&amp;rsquo;, on the
other hand, refers to the phenomenon where a particular piece of information is
sent to the receiver without them asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are essentially pulling information each time you search for stuff using
Google. You are the one who is intentionally asking Google what piece of
information they need to show it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, information is pushed to you when one of your favorite platforms
sends you a push notification from your phone or sends an email to recommend
you to check out their brand-new cool stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that it is not always as easy as this to distinguish whether
information or content you encountered was pulled by you or pushed onto you.
Consider the case where you open YouTube, it is you who initially triggered the
process to open the YouTube, but as soon as you open it, you are welcomed with
a page that is full of video recommendations that you did not specifically ask
for. While from a technical point of view, it might be our HTTP request that
triggered that piece of data to be fetched, from a user point of view, we
see a page that is full of things that we did not initially intend to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="maintaining-balance"&gt;Maintaining Balance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While both pulling and pushing seem to be necessary, an unbalance between these
two concepts makes it harder for us to live mindfully. If you are constantly
being pushed information, you are not actively and intentionally spending your
time. You are like a leaf that is blown away in each wind. Not to mention you
can also be controlled more easily by those apps that you use thanks to their
recommendation algorithms. You converge into what is presented to you.
Likewise, if you are completely closed to information being pushed onto you,
then you are like a closed box, you might miss some of the important stuff
which are happening around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing is, it is much more common for people to lose balance by constantly
information being pushed onto them. So what most of us need is to reduce the
amount to which we are being pushed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pulling-is-usually-better-for-being-intentional"&gt;Pulling is Usually Better for Being Intentional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I reflect on my old school days, most of the things I &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; learned
were not the ones enforced by the school curriculum. They were the topics I
found interesting anyway and took the initiative to learn on my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulling information is a more engaging process than things being pushed onto
you and our brains seem to place higher importance on the subjects we are
actively engaged with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think if we want to live our lives more intentionally, what we should aim for
is to be more active in the way we learn, watch, and do. The alternative is
leaving ourselves at the initiative of the companies&amp;rsquo; recommendation algorithms
which are purposefully designed by professionals so that they keep you on their
apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most of the things we are notified of, or shown are distractions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This being said, what can we do if we want to reduce our exposure to pushed
informations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="reducing-our-exposure-to-pushed-content"&gt;Reducing Our Exposure To Pushed Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly suggest that you go to the notification settings of the applications
you use. &lt;em&gt;Disable all kinds of notifications that you think are not something
you want to see deliberately.&lt;/em&gt; For example if you are using a social media
platform, try to disable all kinds of in-app notifications except mentions,
comments, and so on&amp;hellip; I also highly suggest that you disable push
notifications almost for all the apps you use unless the kind of notifications
that are being pushed to you are not related to things that are urgent like
calls, etc. &lt;em&gt;The end-goal here is not to get rid of all notifications but to
get rid of notifications that are not important for us or neither urgent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, an app might continue to push stuff onto you by sending emails and
so on. &lt;em&gt;Using different emails for primary applications and secondary
applications might help with this as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also, remember that it&amp;rsquo;s a mistake to register an app with your primary email
if you&amp;rsquo;ll only use the app for a brief moment. Use disposable emails for those
cases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have talked about how it is sometimes hard to identify the stuff that is
being pushed on us. In some cases, even a UI element can be thought of as
something that is being pushed to us. And indeed, I think there are many cases
where certain UI designs cause more harm to us than good (while benefitting the
related company). I think &amp;ldquo;recommendations&amp;rdquo; sections are usually one of these.
&lt;em&gt;Seek for alternative, lightweight frontends for the applications you use so
that you are less distracted.&lt;/em&gt; Only Let the app direct you when you need a
direction, otherwise try to remove all the noise. &lt;em&gt;If you can&amp;rsquo;t find
alternative frontends to the web applications you use, you can consider using
Browser extensions that help you to minify the content you see.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Practice mindfulness.&lt;/em&gt; You can set reminders for yourself to check in
periodically (I use &lt;a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bell-of-mindfulness/lggmmceliiaoddfnbaccgpfnpoifilic"&gt;Bell of
Mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;).
Make it a habit to take a breath in and out while asking yourself specific
questions such as, &amp;ldquo;Am I consciously doing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing right now, or am I
just being controlled by the algorithms?&amp;rdquo; This self-reflection can provide
clarity and intentionality to your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, remind yourself that the best thing we can do in order to be less
disturbed and distracted is actually to not use those apps which distract us at
the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="addendum"&gt;Addendum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2024-05-24&lt;/em&gt; : I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a Chrome extension called
&lt;a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne"&gt;Stylus&lt;/a&gt;
that lets you customize the CSS styles of websites. One problem I had with both
the mobile and web versions of WhatsApp was that archived chats were still
easily accessible at the top, even showing a notification icon. I just hid that
section from the UI using this app.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Contemplating Simultaneous Thinking, God and Logos</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I usually enjoy listening to certain types of ambient music or sounds when
doing repetitive tasks or even when meditating. In the comment section of these
kinds of videos, there are often people spreading love and writing nice things
to each other. After consuming so many videos of this kind, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to
predict that these kinds of comments would be present in a video even before
opening them. Sometimes, it felt like I was reading those comments without even
opening them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even right now, it&amp;rsquo;s highly likely that a random individual somewhere in the
world is contemplating spreading love and positive energy. I don&amp;rsquo;t know
anything about them, yet this statement probably holds true. Now, if I were to
feel a certain affection for this person and they also had the thought of
&amp;ldquo;there&amp;rsquo;s probably another random person out there spreading love,&amp;rdquo; would this
constitute a very basic form of interaction?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a simple game, such as XOX. The algorithm you need to follow is pretty
straightforward. Even with the many possible game states, you can generally
categorize most of the outcomes &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_loss_of_generality"&gt;without loss of
generality&lt;/a&gt;. Now,
let&amp;rsquo;s suppose there are other people in different physical locations who know
the algorithm for playing the game. Assume that these people are also thinking
about the other people whom also contemplate this game in their heads. If these
people were to play O and X in their minds, the algorithm they follow would
dictate how they play which means that they could predict the other person&amp;rsquo;s
moves even without physically interacting with them. Given this scenario, could
we say that these individuals have actually played the game together although
never seeing each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The points I&amp;rsquo;ve made above are basically results of our human ability for
abstract thinking. We can think reflectively and about specific phenomena, as
well as ponder those who thought about these phenomena before us, or thinking
about right now. In essence, it seems to be possible to think about specific
things simultaneously with other people and even predict their thoughts if the
domain in which the thinking is occurring has clear rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to become more rational, would I become more aware of others'
feelings or thoughts of those people whom I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen or physically
interacted with? Would I be able to have simple interactions with them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could also be related to how an omniscient God would understand each of
us, as it would possess knowledge of all logical possibilities. This might even
explain why people who believe in God often feel less alone. If God does exist,
we would never be alone in our thoughts, as there would always be a presence
accompanying us &lt;strong&gt;as long as we are aware&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if any of these thoughts even make sense. However, all
of these concepts remind me of the Stoics&amp;rsquo; understanding of
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logos"&gt;Logos&lt;/a&gt;. Stoics believed that those who
are capable of reasoning are part of the same community as they were all
interconnected through Logos whether they are physically close to each other or
not.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>An Argument for Idealism</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay was originally written for the &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Philosophy I&amp;rsquo;
(PHIL103) course at Bilkent University, where we delved into various branches of
philosophy, including consciousness. It reflects some of the thought processes
that arose as I grappled with these philosophical questions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to
note that this essay is not an exact reflection of my personal beliefs, but
rather an exercise in argumentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite this, I believe the arguments presented in this essay hold value and are
worth exploring. My hope is that this essay provides you with insight and
provokes thought, and that you find value in engaging with the ideas presented
here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believing in a particular framework that describes the nature of existence,
known as an ontology, can greatly influence an individual&amp;rsquo;s perspective on life
and their actions. Three such ontologies are Physicalism, Dualism and Idealism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicalism states that all phenomena can be explained in terms of physical
concepts. If a person believes in Physicalism, they may prioritize material
possessions and physical experiences, and focus on achieving practical goals.
This belief can also affect their beliefs about the afterlife and the nature of
the self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dualism, on the other hand, is a view that posits the existence of two
fundamental and distinct kinds of substances or principles: matter and mind.
This view is similar to Physicalism in that both agree that there exist physical
objects. But is different in the sense that it holds that the mind and the body
are distinct entities that cannot be reduced into one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I argue that we have sufficient reason to believe that objects
that exist are not physical, refuting both Physicalism and Dualism. I do this by first
showing that the existence of physical objects cannot be known, and then
combining this belief with the principle of parsimony, also known as Ockham&amp;rsquo;s
Razor. As a result, this argument supports the ontology of Idealism, which is
the view that reality is ultimately mental in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="argument"&gt;Argument&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me present you the outline of my argument:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P1. If agents can know whether something exists, then they know so a priori
or a posteriori.&lt;br&gt;
P2. Agents don’t know a priori whether physical objects exist.&lt;br&gt;
P3. Agents don’t know a posteriori whether physical objects exist.&lt;br&gt;
C1. Agents cannot know whether physical objects exist.&lt;br&gt;
P4. If existance of a thing cannot be known and assuming it does not give us
more explanatory power than what we are left without it, then there is
no reason assuming it exists. (parsimony principle)&lt;br&gt;
P5. Assuming existence of physical objects does not give us more explanatory
power than what we are left without it.&lt;br&gt;
C2. There is no reason for assuming that physical objects exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first premise &lt;strong&gt;(P1)&lt;/strong&gt; is very easy to see, if not self-evident. By
definition, a priori knowledge means the knowledge we gain without experiencing
whereas a posteriori knowledge means the knowledge we gain with experience. It
is either one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real challenge is to show that P2 and P3 are true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;(P2)&lt;/strong&gt;, we can say that agents&amp;rsquo; understanding of physical objects are
fundamentally acquired through the sensory experiences they have. For example,
physicists do not know the behavior of an electron until they perform certain
experiments, such as observing its interactions with other particles or
measuring its properties using certain equipments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, keep in mind that a priori knowledge is the knowledge that is not
contingent. Whereas it is not possible to conceive a triangle that has 4 sides,
it is, possible to conceive physical objects not being exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(P3)&lt;/strong&gt; can be deduced by claiming that a representation is not the same thing
as the thing it represents, and that what we don&amp;rsquo;t deal with physical objects
themselves, but with their representations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Representation of a thing, is not the same thing as it represents.&lt;/em&gt; For
example, a wine in a menu is not the same thing as a wine, for you cannot drink
the wine in a menu but the wine itself. The words we use for describing stuff,
the concepts we have in minds are also representations of things. When it comes
to representations, there always are stuff that you can do with one but not with
another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, our experiences of the world are limited by the capabilities of our
senses. We can only perceive a small range of colors and other sensory
information, and this information is not experienced directly but is interpreted
by our brains. This is why we can be susceptible to optical illusions and other
forms of sensory deception. Additionally, our experiences of physical objects
are not of the objects themselves, but of their representations in our minds.
This means that &lt;em&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t deal with physical objects themselves, but with their
representations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is analagous to one of the metaphors Donald Hoffman, a cognitive scientist,
likes to use. The sensory systems that humans possess (such as touch, smell,
sight, sound, and hearing) function as a user interface that hides the true
complexity of reality (e.g. the circuits and voltages in a computer) and allows
individuals to control and interact with it without needing to understand it. He
compares this to the way that a desktop interface on a computer hides the inner
workings of the device and allows users to control it through icons and actions
like dragging and clicking (Hoffman).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(P4)&lt;/strong&gt; is also referred as principly of parsimony, or Ockham&amp;rsquo;s Razor. The
principle helps us to simplify our thinking by reducing the number of competing
frameworks that compete with each other. There are two reasons I follow this
reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, whether we know reality is necessarily simple or not, unless there is a
good reason or advantage to believe a concept over other explanations, we are
justified in not believing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, we already use this principle a lot when doing science. In general,
the massive embracement and success of this principle in scientific fields
provides a reason to think that it is a useful and reliable guide for
eliminating certain hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, let us consider &lt;strong&gt;(P5)&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In P3, we demonstrated that our understanding of the world is derived from our
experiences and observations. This is based on representations, not the things
themselves. We do not obtain these representations after having the concept of
physical objects; rather, it is the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even without accepting the existence of physical objects, we are already capable
of conducting science. Our assumption of the existence of physical objects is
simply a mental shortcut that we use to try and comprehend our surroundings.
However, we do not necessarily need this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all of the regularities that we observe in the world would still be
possible even if we only accepted the existence of mental substances. In this
way, what we refer to as physical objects would be fundamentally a type of
mental substance. This does not violate Ockham&amp;rsquo;s Razor, as there are already
strong arguments, such as Descartes&amp;rsquo; cogito ergo sum, that support the existence
of mental things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="criticisms"&gt;Criticisms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have proposed my position in advance, it is now a good time to
consider some of the potential criticisms and misconceptions that could be
raised against this position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-it-that-is-represented"&gt;What is it that is represented?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If physical objects does not exists, and the only thing that we deal with is
physical representations, then what is it that is represented? There cant be a
representation of a thing that does not exist.&amp;rdquo; one might say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I agree with the part that if something is represented, then a thing
exists. The part that I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with is that physical representations are
the representations of objects that are physical objects which are independent
of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now a great time to clarify what I mean by physical objects and physical
representations. In this argument, I used the expression &amp;ldquo;physical objects&amp;rdquo; not
in the sense that a substance that can be fully explainable through physics. If
that would be the case then it would be wild that I claim such objects does not
exist. By physical objects, I refer to objects that exists independently of
mind. Physical representation, on the other hand, are the kind of
representations that are made in Physics. This representations, by themselves,
does not require what is required to be independent of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, idealists does not necessarily reject physical objects does not
exist in the sense that there are objects which can be explained by physics but
in the sense we prescribed above. When certain a spiritualist says &amp;ldquo;Matter is a
way of seeing, not something that is seen&amp;rdquo; (Spira) they seem to be agreeing that
there exists objects that can be understood from the perspective of Physics but
disagree with the part that those objects are abstract, mind-independent
substances by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ockhams-razor-is-not-reliable"&gt;Ockham&amp;rsquo;s Razor is not reliable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument relies on Ockham&amp;rsquo;s Razor, which states that the simplest
explanation is most likely to be true. However, this assumption may not always
hold true. Some may argue that we do not have sufficient evidence to assume that
reality is simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one can believe that reality is not supposed to be ontologically
simple, they can still be epistemically justified to favor the simplest
explanation when faced with multiple possibilities. This does not have to be the
case because the reality is ontologically simple, but rather, it is the best we
can do: In the absence of other compelling evidence when comparing seemingly
equivalent explanations, it is already justified to choose one of the theories
randomly, so why not just choose the simpler one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="direct-perception-of-physical-objects"&gt;Direct Perception of Physical Objects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to reject P3 by saying that direct perception of physical objects
is possible. One could say that a representation of a thing can be seen as
identical to the thing itself if the function of the representation is the same
as the thing it represents. For example, one might argue that if a photograph of
a cup were able to serve the same function as the actual cup it represents, then
they could be seen as identical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this approach ignores all the other aspects of entities besides their
functions. Even though the photograph and the cup may function in the same way,
they are not necessarily the same thing unless they are made of the same
substances and share the same inner workings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, I have come to the conclusion that there is no reason for assume
that physical objects exist according to the principly of parsimony. I have done
this by first arguin that agents cannot know whether physical objects exist. And
then showing that assuming the existence of physical objects does not give us
more explanatory power than what we are left without it.&lt;/p&gt;
