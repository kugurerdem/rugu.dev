Some of these are due to habits (like having a feeling of missing out), some are due to reasons related to dopamine (like watching movies, tv-series or content which are supposed to be fun), and some are related to work (software development) or productivity (writing, communicating, researching). So, I am regularly exposed to all kinds of stimulants that are available on the internet.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: The Art of Living by Thich Nhat Hanh</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/taol-by-nhat-hanh/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/taol-by-nhat-hanh/</guid><description>After finishing the book &amp;ldquo;Siddhartha&amp;rdquo; by Hermann Hesse, I felt a need to explore Buddhism in more detail. People often say that the core teachings of Buddha offer a simple philosophy, which consists of only a few precepts and essential concepts. I figured that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t hurt to spend some time understanding the core principles of Buddhism, one of the most influential religions and lifestyle philosophies. So, I started searching for resources to learn more about it.</description></item><item><title>Contemplating Simultaneous Thinking, God and Logos</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/contemplation-1/</guid><description>I usually enjoy listening to certain types of ambient music or sounds when doing repetitive tasks or even when meditating. In the comment section of these kinds of videos, there are often people spreading love and writing nice things to each other. After consuming so many videos of this kind, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to predict that these kinds of comments would be present in a video even before opening them. Sometimes, it felt like I was reading those comments without even opening them.</description></item><item><title>An Argument for Idealism</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/idealism-argument/</guid><description>This essay was originally written for the &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Philosophy I&amp;rsquo; (PHIL103) course at Bilkent University, where we delved into various branches of philosophy, including consciousness. It reflects some of the thought processes that arose as I grappled with these philosophical questions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that this essay is not an exact reflection of my personal beliefs, but rather an exercise in argumentation.
Despite this, I believe the arguments presented in this essay hold value and are worth exploring.</description></item></channel></rss>
