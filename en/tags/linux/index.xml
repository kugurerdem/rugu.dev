it for about a month. I want to share my migration experience in case it might
interest or even help others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also want to thank my friends &lt;a href="https://github.com/onsah">Onur&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mk-nlp">Mert&lt;/a> for encouraging me to switch to NixOS and
providing help.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As someone who likes playing with tools to understand how they work as well as
to match my preferences and ergonomic choices, I find myself frequently changing many
configurations on my system. However, it didn&amp;rsquo;t take long for me to realize
that I need a system to save and possibly automate these configuration
processes to save time in the future.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Debloating My Android Phone with ADB</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/debloat-with-adb/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/debloat-with-adb/</guid><description>&lt;p>My mother recently mentioned that her phone is continually opening certain
windows and prompting her to use services she doesn’t need. After checking her
phone and doing some online research, I found out that many others have also
complained about this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently, she was referring to pop-ups triggered by a pre-built program
called &amp;ldquo;SIM Menu&amp;rdquo;. This program basically allows operators to send
notifications and even generate pop-ups on your phone. And the frustrating part
is that most of these pop-ups seem to promote irrelevant services. If you
accidentally click &amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo; when one of these pop-ups appears, you get charged by
your provider. It is a carefully set up trap designed to make you accidentally
subscribe to their unnecessary services and pay money.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Understanding Keyboard Events Better</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/understanding-keyboard-events/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/understanding-keyboard-events/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this essay, I describe how I made a Node.js module to listen to keypresses
across the system on Linux machines using X. This experience helped me grasp
how the OS and Window Managers handle keyboard inputs, clarifying the reasons
behind an unexpected behavior I had encountered before, which I also mention in
the essay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more about how keyboard events are handled,
this essay might be of interest to you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Experience on Switching to Arch Linux</title><link>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/en/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</guid><description>&lt;p>About a year ago, I was invited to a pair coding session at the startup where I
was working. The developers were receiving consultancy from a strange person. At
one point, he took control of the screen sharing while reviewing some of the
pull requests that had been made to our codebase. When he shared his screen,
there was nothing but a black screen. Suddenly, a terminal screen appeared with
his keystrokes and he quickly began examining the codebase, providing feedback
on people&amp;rsquo;s code at a speed I had never seen before. He was able to jump between
different files in an instant, examining the diffs that were made in different
git commits.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
