I like reading blog posts a lot. While some of them are short and easy to read, most of them are long and require more time to finish. When reading those long essays, I take a break most of the time. Thus, when I re-open an essay, I often lose the original place where I was reading. And if I can remember where I was, then I manually scroll back there.</description></item></channel></rss>
