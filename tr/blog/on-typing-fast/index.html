one&rsquo;s typing ability but ability to think clearly and logically, and to design
and organize the architecture effectively. Afterall, programing is more than
just typing. If it was just typing we would expect to see the difference between
in terms of the time and effort required for rewriting an already existing
project with that of creating it from scratch for the first time to be too
small. However what we see is not &ldquo;a bit less&rdquo; but a huge difference.</p><p>While I agree that those mentioned properties of a software mentioned more
important than typing speed, I do not like the fact that this reasoning is
mostly used for justifying on how typing fast is not important for developers.
It is not a healthy approach to solely focus on the time and cost difference
between rewriting a piece of code and writing it for the first time, measured
purely in terms of the time spent typing. This is because the time spent typing
while building a project involves not only the final product code but also all
the tests and iterations made throughout the development cycle, as well as
the questions posed to the internet and communication made with other team
members.</p><p>Yes, it&rsquo;s essential to spend time on the architecture of the code, technology
stack, and requirement specifications. However this doesn&rsquo;t diminish the
importance of typing fast. I agree that typing is one of the least significant
aspects of the development process, this is why I put an emphasis on typing fast
so much (notice that I do use the phrase typing fast in a different way than
typing by itself). In essence, reducing the time spent on typing allows us to
allocate more time to actual work. In other words, typing faster saves time and
enables us to focus on the more critical aspects of development.</p><p><strong>Even though typing itself is shallow and unimportant, typing fast is one of
the most critical skills for developers because it reduces the time spent on an
insignificant task of typing.</strong></p><p>This reasoning is similar to what <em>Hans Hoffman</em> once said:</p><blockquote><p>“The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the
necessary may speak.”</p></blockquote><p>Typing is the way we actualize our ideas into real programs.</p><p>Assume that you generate your ideas at a rate of 3X per unit of time, but you
can only actualize X of them in that same time. This means that the number of
non-actualized ideas will accumulate until you eventually reach a position where
you have to abandon some of them (due to having a mental stack overflow).
Essentially, the faster you can transform your ideas into code and test them,
the less likely you are to experience an overflow of untested and undeveloped
ideas.</p><p>Of course, it would be imprudent to assume that the pace of idea generation will
consistently surpass that of execution. However it is still important to
acknowledge that circumstances may arise where physical constraints such as
limited typing speed can hinder one&rsquo;s ability to bring ideas to fruition.</p><h2 id=setting-up-a-goal>Setting up a Goal</h2><p>Assuming that typing speed is indeed as important as stated, it is crucial to
determine how fast we should type to avoid the bottlenecks mentioned above.</p><p>Setting a goal is indeed a subjective process that depends on an individual&rsquo;s
expectations. Personally, I believe that thinking in terms of how many words we
speak per minute is a good metric to use as it is the speed at which we
typically express our ideas. The higher the ratio of typing WPM to speaking
WPM, the better for avoiding bottlenecks. Studies show that the average typing
speed of the people is around 40 (WPM) [1]. In contrast, the average rate of
speech for native English speakers is around 150 WPM [2].</p><p>Another critical aspect I like to consider when setting up a criteria for typing
speed is the concept of &ldquo;diminishing returns&rdquo; [3]. Increasing your average
typing speed from 140 to 150 might be two or three times harder than increasing
it from 50 to 100. Therefore, it may not be cost-effective after achieving a
certain point of typing speed.</p><p>Here is an example probability density curve [4] that can give you an idea
about the distribution of people by their typing speed:</p><p><img src=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna-Feit-2/publication/324659119/figure/fig2/AS:617652846338048@1524271322602/Histogram-and-density-estimate-of-WPM-uncorrected-errors-IKI-and-keypress-duration.png#center alt></p><p>Despite my personal record of 144 WPM, I typically type around 90-110 WPM [5].
I believe that having an average speed of 80 WPM would be more than sufficient
for most people in terms of cost-effectiveness. However, I still want to
improve my typing speed a bit more by learning a typing technique called
touch-typing which is ergonomically just better than what I do right now.</p><h2 id=improvements>Improvements</h2><p>So what can we do to improve our typing speed? Here are the first things that
come to my mind:</p><ul><li><p>Type regularly: The best way to learn a skill that requires a muscle memory
is just to repeat the things over and over again. Simply put: the more you
practice typing, the faster you will become. Set aside time each day to
practice typing, and try to increase your speed gradually.</p></li><li><p>Use typing software: There are many typing software programs available that
can help you improve and measure your typing speed. I usually use
<a href=10fastfingers.com>10FastFingers</a> and <a href=https://play.typeracer.com/>Type Racer</a>.</p></li><li><p>Learn touch typing: touch typing is a technique where you become accustomed
to using all 10 of your fingers to type without looking at the keyboard.
While I am skeptical that this directly increases speed, I believe it can
indirectly improve your typing speed by increasing accuracy. I also think
that it increases endurance by making the process more ergonomic for the
typist since you no longer have to raise your hand as much as you used to.</p></li><li><p>Improve your typing posture: Your typing posture can also affect your typing
speed. Sit up straight, keep your wrists and fingers in a neutral position,
and make sure your keyboard is at the right height. Just google &ldquo;typing
posture&rdquo;. Not to mention that these kind of things are also important for
your long term health.</p></li><li><p>USE VIM! VIM is a powerful text editor that allows users to manipulate text
with keyboard shortcuts. It reduces the need for manual navigation and makes
it easy to perform repetitive tasks. VIM has advanced features such as
macros, registers, and plugins that can further increase efficiency. By using
VIM, you can avoid moving your hands away from the keyboard, which can save
time and increase typing speed. VIM&rsquo;s features streamline workflow and
increase productivity, making it an excellent choice for programmers and
writers.</p></li></ul><p>For developers, I strongly recommend becoming accustomed to using the English
keyboard layout since most programming languages are designed to use symbols
readily available on a US keyboard, such as {}[]/`\"&rsquo;, which may not be as
easily accessible on other layouts, (e.g. Turkish layout).</p><h1 id=glossary>Glossary</h1><p>[1] Average typing speed infographic. Ratatype. (n.d.). Retrieved March 3,
