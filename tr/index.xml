one&amp;rsquo;s typing ability but ability to think clearly and logically, and to design
and organize the architecture effectively. Afterall, programing is more than
just typing. If it was just typing we would expect to see the difference between
in terms of the time and effort required for rewriting an already existing
project with that of creating it from scratch for the first time to be too
small. However what we see is not &amp;ldquo;a bit less&amp;rdquo; but a huge difference.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Experience on Switching to Arch Linux</title><link>https://rugu.dev/tr/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/tr/blog/switching-to-archlinux/</guid><description>&lt;p>About a year ago, I was invited to a pair coding session at the startup where I
was working. The developers were receiving consultancy from a strange person. At
one point, he took control of the screen sharing while reviewing some of the
pull requests that had been made to our codebase. When he shared his screen,
there was nothing but a black screen. Suddenly, a terminal screen appeared with
his keystrokes and he quickly began examining the codebase, providing feedback
on people&amp;rsquo;s code at a speed I had never seen before. He was able to jump between
different files in an instant, examining the diffs that were made in different
git commits.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An Argument for Idealism</title><link>https://rugu.dev/tr/blog/idealism-argument/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rugu.dev/tr/blog/idealism-argument/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This essay was originally written for the &amp;lsquo;Introduction to Philosophy I&amp;rsquo;
(PHIL103) course at Bilkent University, where we delved into various branches of
philosophy, including consciousness. It reflects some of the thought processes
that arose as I grappled with these philosophical questions. It&amp;rsquo;s important to
note that this essay is not an exact reflection of my personal beliefs, but
rather an exercise in argumentation.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Despite this, I believe the arguments presented in this essay hold value and are
worth exploring. My hope is that this essay provides you with insight and
provokes thought, and that you find value in engaging with the ideas presented
here.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
