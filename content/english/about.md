Full-stack software developer with a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Bilkent
University (2021). I have been building software products since 2015.

I am **a developer with a hacker’s mindset**. I dive deep into the technologies
I use and study the philosophy behind them. I use ~~Arch Linux~~ NixOS as
desktop OS, Vim to edit and write, and [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kugurerdem) to indulge.

I highly value **philosophy**, particularly **rational thinking.** So I
incorporate this value into how I approach software. **To me, having a proper
understanding of the fundamentals of the tools and concepts we use on the
regular is far more valuable than to know any framework.** I find it a
requirement for success to have a philosophy of doing things for delivering
products. And that’s what I try to achieve with some of my writings here.
