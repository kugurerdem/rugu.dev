Hello! And thank you for visiting my website. This is where I talk about who I
am, what I do, and how to contact me.

### Who?

My full name is UÄŸur Erdem Seyfi,

I am a **full-stack software developer** with an academic background of
**Mathematics** and **Computer Science**. I have been professionally building
Software Products for **since 2021**, yet my first introduction to Software
Development can be traced back to my high school years in 2015.

To give you a more idea, I guess we can say that I am **a developer with a
hacker's mindset**. I try to dive deep into the technologies I use and to
understand their underlying philosophies. I use ~~**Arch Linux**~~ **NixOS** as
my desktop OS, use **Vim** to edit and write text,  play with the tools
that I am given, spend my free time on [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kugurerdem), and write regularly.

I highly value **philosophy**, particularly **rational thinking**. So I try to
incorporate this side of mine to how I approach software as well. **I think
having a proper understanding of the fundamentals of the tools and concepts we
regularly use is a way more valuable skill than to know XYZ framework**. I find
it a requirement for success to have a philosophy of doing things for
delivering products. And that's what I am trying to achieve with some of my
writings.
