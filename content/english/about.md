# Hi! I'm Uğur

I write about software development, philosophy, and psychology, mostly through self-observations.

I highly value understanding fundamentals and rational thinking, and I try to incorporate these values into how I approach software. This effort also runs through much of my writing here.

Also, I use Arch and NeoVim. 😏
