Full-stack software developer with a B.Sc. in Mathematics from Bilkent University (2023). I've been building software since 2015 and working professionally since 2021.

In this blog, I write about a variety of topics related to software development, philosophy, and psychology. Most of the posts are self-reflections on subjects I either experiment with, learn about, or casually think about.

I highly value **philosophy**, particularly **rational thinking.** So I incorporate this value into how I approach software. **To me, having a proper understanding of the fundamentals of the tools and concepts we use on the regular is far more valuable than to know any framework.** I find it a requirement for success to have a philosophy of doing things for delivering products. And that‚Äôs also a part of what I try to achieve with some of my writings here.

I use Arch (and NeoVim), btw. üòè
