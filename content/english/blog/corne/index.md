title: "Using Corne Keyboard For Half A Year"
date: 2025-12-17

I built my own Corne keyboard around half a year ago. I have been using it ever since July. Although I am no expert on split keyboards, I accumulated a fair amount of observations during this whole process. So, I thought that if I wrote down my experiences, it could still be of interest to people who are just considering whether or not to switch to a split keyboard, or, if they are already using one, could further benefit from some of the tricks that helped me a lot. So, here it is: a blog post about how and why I built my own Corne keyboard, and the things I learned and applied to improve my keyboard ergonomics over the last 5 months.

I will first talk about my overall reasons for choosing such a niche keyboard to use, then why and how I built it, and finally share some very cool tips and tricks about how I played with the layout to make my Corne fit my specific needs better.

Let us get started without losing any more time. :)

## Why A Split Keyboard?

Whenever a friend sees my Corne keyboard, they usually ask what it is, where I got it from, and why I am using it. Sometimes they want to try it, and I let them play around with it for a bit. After a few minutes, the reaction is almost always the same: they tell me that it is hard and frustrating to use. I understand this. It definitely looks strange, and it is far from a natural typing experience for someone who is used to a "normal" keyboard. Still, I want to try my best to explain why I decided to use a split keyboard in the first place.

I can think of three possible reasons for using a split keyboard. First, they look cool, and some people simply enjoy trying cool things. Second, there is the promise of improved typing speed or efficiency. Third, and most importantly for me, they are often more ergonomic and natural for the body. I admit that the aesthetics played a small role in my decision as well, but for me, the primary factor that convinced me try a split keyboard was simply ergonomics.

For some context, I have been dealing with neck and back pain for quite a while. Because of that, I had already spent a lot of time thinking about office ergonomics. I regularly use laptop and monitor stands to keep my screen at eye level. I pay attention to chair and desk height, distance, and how they relate to my posture and leg position. I have also invested in a standing desk and a chair that I find comfortable for long work sessions. I also started learning more about biomechanics and began exercising more regularly. [^workout-vs-ergonomics]

[^workout-vs-ergonomics]: I can say that exercise helped me the most on a personal level. Still, paying attention to ergonomics was also very helpful. To me, exercise feels like a way to increase my overall tolerance, while improving ergonomics is more about reducing the damage being taken. Because of that, I wanted to take the best of both worlds as much as possible.

This led me to think about how I could further improve my ergonomics. After some thinking, it became obvious that the two things I interact with the most when using a computer are my keyboard and mouse. A quick research pointed me toward two promising upgrades for my setup: a split keyboard and a vertical mouse.

Both made sense to me. A vertical mouse more closely resembles a neutral hand position, which can help reduce awkward wrist movements. **With a split keyboard, the ability to position the two halves independently allows the wrists to remain in a more neutral alignment. This same split setup, combined with the option to place the halves farther apart, also helps reduce internal shoulder rotation. Over time, this can improve shoulder comfort and may even reduce strain in the neck.**

To give you a brief idea, the following image I found from [boardsource.xyz](https://boardsource.xyz/products/unicorne-lp-aluminum-corne-case) demonstrates this really well.

So, a split keyboard it is. But there is still one very important question: why choose the Corne over the many other split keyboards available?

## Why Corne, Specifically?

When I first looked into the list of split keyboards being recommended, I was baffled. Not only are there so many alternatives, but they also differ a lot.

Just to give an example, consider X and Y. These are both split keyboards, but do you see how much they differ from each other?

This is how I quickly realized that it would be better for me to first set my expectations and then filter them, instead of trying to learn all the subtleties of these keyboards and then trying to make an educated guess.

Since it would be my first attempt to try a split keyboard, I thought it would be a nice idea to choose a keyboard with at least **a bit of a community around it**, so that I could benefit from the experiences of other people and find answers to my questions if I ever had them.

The split keyboard **being open source** was also really important to me, because rebuying it if something ever went wrong was not an option for me. Not just because of the prices, but also due to some customs regulations that make it much harder for people where I live (Turkey) to order items from foreign countries above a certain threshold (currently 30 Euro). There is also not much of a marketplace for split keyboards here in Turkey. So, I either needed to ask for my friends who were abroad to buy the things for me, or, obtain the parts seperately and solder and assemble it myself. I thought with the latter option, at least, I would not be as dependant as the first option. I could still ask for help, but, if things would go southway, fixing things myself would at least be possible.

And of course, **it had to be ergonomic**. In fact, I was okay with going with split keyboards that prioritize ergonomics more, even at the expense of challenging my habits. I was okay to try new things if I was convinced of the possible benefits.

So, after some market research, my final decision came down to [Corne vs Lily58](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/comments/17ygfe5/lily58_vs_corne_for_a_first_timer/). Both of them seemed to satisfy my main requirements, with one key difference between them. The Lily58 has 58 keys, while the Corne has only 42.

In practice, this means that the entire number row and a few additional keys are removed on the Corne to make it more compact. Access to those missing keys is handled through layer combinations instead. On paper, I liked the idea that it would reduce overall hand movement. However, my main concern was whether I would actually like the experience or not.

Since I could not clearly decide which one to go with, I went YOLO. I decided to build the Corne myself, and asked my friend Onur to bring me Lily58 from Germany as a gift.

## What About Lily58?

-> The problem is the moment it arrived to me, I was so fond of Corne, that I did not even look at the face of Lily58, and just decided to hand off to one of my friends who were also interested in split keyboards, Çobanov

## The Overall User Experience

- İlk iki hafta nasıl geçti? Genel deneyim nasıldı? 
- Layout improvements, alt gr problemi
- Hold or tap behavour, using home row modifier keys
- One thing I quickly noticed using this keyboard was that it shifts some of the load put on pinkies before into thumbs. {thumb agrisi, ama ayni gun barfiks ve knuckle pushup cekmis olman}
- Combo keys

## The End Goal

Corne is so far so good. 

Since I already use my 3x6 corne as if it is 3x5 in terms of the keys I use in my layout, I am now thinking of building another
